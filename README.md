### What I'm trying to do with this app is to make people's mornings a little happier. 
### On the back end, using .NET Core, I will try to set up a database with funny jokes and other good things that people like to hear or read. 
### On the front end, with React, I will try to build a pleasant, user-friendly app that will give the customers the possibility to schedule at their convenient time and day of the week a funny random text message.
### Let's see how close I can get to my goal. :)
